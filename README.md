Welcome to my GitHub. I am currently a master at Tsinghua University. My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** â€“ with a special focus on "**video representation learning**", "**action recognization**". If you have any questions on my projects, please feel free to [send me an email](mailto:y-ma21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn). Check my [homepage]( https://mayuelala.github.io/) to learn more about me.
